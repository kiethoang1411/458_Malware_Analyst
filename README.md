# CPSC 458: Malware Analysis Class
My CPSC 458 reports, a course dedicated to learning and understanding the world of malware analysis. In this class, we focus on analyzing malicious software, understanding its behavior, and exploring various techniques and tools used by cybersecurity professionals to identify and mitigate malware threats.

## Course Objectives
- Understand the fundamental concepts of malware and its various types.
- Learn how to use industry-standard tools for malware analysis.
- Gain hands-on experience in dissecting malware to understand its structure and behavior.
- Develop skills to create YARA rules for malware detection.
- Understand the impact of malware on security and best practices for prevention.

## Tools Used in the Class
Throughout the course, I worked with various tools designed for malware analysis. Here's a list of the key tools I use:

- **ApateDNS**: A DNS spoofing tool used to test the behavior of malware in a controlled environment.
- **PE_Bear**: A Portable Executable (PE) analysis tool for examining the structure of Windows executables.
- **PeStudio**: A static analysis tool to analyze Windows executables for potential malicious indicators.
- **Ghidra**: A reverse-engineering tool for decompiling and analyzing binaries.
- **x64dbg**: A popular debugger for analyzing the runtime behavior of executables.
- **ProcessExplorer**: A system monitoring tool to track processes and resource usage.
- **ProcessMonitor**: A detailed system monitoring tool for analyzing registry and file system changes.
- **Regshot**: A registry snapshot tool to compare system states before and after running malware.
- **Strings**: A utility to extract readable strings from binary files, useful for finding clues in malware.
- **YARA**: A tool for creating rules to identify patterns in files, useful for detecting malware.
- **Remnux**: A Linux distribution designed for reverse-engineering and analyzing malware.
- **VirusTotal**: An online platform for scanning files and URLs to detect known malware.

## Course Structure
The course is divided into the following sections:

1. **Introduction to Malware**: Learn about different types of malware, their characteristics, and common attack vectors.
2. **Static Analysis**: Explore static analysis techniques to understand malware without executing it.
3. **Dynamic Analysis**: Use debugging and monitoring tools to examine the behavior of malware in real-time.
4. **Reverse Engineering**: Gain insights into the inner workings of malware through reverse-engineering techniques.
5. **Malware Detection**: Learn how to create YARA rules and other methods to detect malware.
6. **Case Studies**: Analyze real-world malware samples and discuss their impact.
